# Hello world!

I'm Rafael Carrasco (he/him), a Brazilian programmer. My main goal is to develop software that helps our world to be a little better -- and also have fun along the way, because why not?

Some facts about me:

  - :elephant: I'm mainly a PHP developer.
  - :deciduous_tree: I'm eager to collaborate on any kind of environmental software.
  - :hourglass_flowing_sand: I've been programming for almost two decades already.
  - :seedling: I'm slowly learning (and loving!) Haskell.
  - :full_moon: My favorite programming language is Lua.
  - :cow::pig::chicken: I'm vegan.
  
And that's it. Have a nice day!
